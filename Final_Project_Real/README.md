## Project Information
### Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs: Digital Asset to Digital Indentity
    Per their creator YugaLabs, The Bored Ape Yacht Club is a collection of 10,000 unique Bored Ape NFTsâ€” unique
      digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Since their release in 2021, Bored Apes have become a

      grew to become important.
