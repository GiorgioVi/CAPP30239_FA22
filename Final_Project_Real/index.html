  <H1>Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs: Digital Asset to Digital Indentity</H1>
  <h4>By Giorgio Vidali</h4>

  <p>
    <h2>
        What are Bored Apes? 
  </h2>

  <p>
    Per their creator YugaLabs, The Bored Ape Yacht Club is a collection of 10,000 unique Bored Ape NFTsâ€” unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. In reality, Bored Apes have become a pillar of the NFT asset class, and a sign of social status. 
    Looking back to to their inception in 2021, we need to understand how these assets grew to become so important.

    <h2>Bored Ape Sale Volume From May 2021 to October 2022</h2>
    <p> After originally releasing in the end of April 2021, Bored Ape NFTs started to capture significant media and financial attention. Assets which were supposedly
      'valueless' were starting to account for almost $25 Million of transactions by May 2021. Few would have predicted the surges of August 2021 and January 2022
      where Bored Apes started having around $300 Million of transactions. Or even that Sotheby's would list a group of 101 Bored Apes at auction. 
      However, like every bull run... people stop buying. Since May 2022 monthly volume has continued
      to drop.

    <h2>Why should we care about Bored Ape Traits?</h2>
    <p>One of the defining charateristics of Bored Apes is that every Ape is completely unique, but all are comprised from the same group of 168 traits. 
      Having traits helps people associate with their ape and in turn can be used to represent owners on digital media. Doctors can buy apes that Lab Coats, Ranchers
      can buy an Ape with Cowboy Hat. There are all types of traits that people can choose, which ultimately leads to some having a strong following. Many valuation
      experts agree that Gold Fur is the most valuable trait. Unsurprisingly, it is also the rarest. Ultimately, being able to choose an digital asset of traits that 
      you like can be a demonstration of your personality or the things that you enjoy. If you look on twitter, many prominent members of the NFT community 
      proudly brandish their Bored Apes as their profile pictures.

    <h2>Bored Apes are expensive</h2>
    <p> At realease a Bored Ape costed 0.08 Ether or around $236. Less than six months later you would of had to fork over over $100,000 to buy one. People often question
      why someone would spend such large sums on these 'jpegs', the reality is that if there is large enough demand, and people suspect the price may rise even more, Bored Apes 
      appear as somewhat safe investments. The one drawback of owning a Bored Ape is price volatility. In a little over a year we saw the prices rise from a few thousand
      to hundreds of thousands, back to around a hundred thousand. If you bought early you may have made a fortune, if you bought at the top... not so much.

    <h2>How do Bored Apes compare to major cryptocurrencies?</h2>

    <p> Only one month after their inception, one Bored Ape cost on average as much as one Ethereum. Only two months later, a Bored Ape was worth as 
      much as one Bitcoin. Many questioned whether or not a Bored Ape was rising in price only because of the crypto bull run. If we look at February 2022,
      when crypto assets were dropping, the Price of Bored Apes continued to rise. Still, when the crypto market started to really crash aroune June, we saw
      the crossover effects in the price of a Bored Ape. Its difficult to predict the future, but many important figures are claiming that NFTs will become less 
      correlated with crypto prices and swings.
    </p>
    <h2>Digital Asset Comparison Over Time</h2>
    <p>The following graph shows the natural log of the price of a Bored Ape each month, to the natural log of the price of one Ethereum and Bitcoin, on the first
      of the month.

    <h2>Who bought that? For How much???</h2>

    <p> If you were early on Bored Apes, it would be reasonable that one would be able to purchase one. However, only within three months, these assets were worth
      over $100,000. Who then was spending money on these monkeys? As Bored Apes became a social phenomenon celebrities from all categories began to buy Apes. 
      Some were smart and bought for cheap, Justin Bieber on the other hand, paid over 10X what his Bored Ape is worth today. Many of these celebrities 
      had their Apes as their profile pictures on social media. In particular, Neymar had one of his two Bored Apes as his instagram profile picture for over
      six months. Still, there are 10,000 Bored Apes, so clearly there had to be some other 'normal' people who bought into the project as well.
