# Week 03

## Data Source
This data is sourced directly from the Ethereum blockchain. I used an API to get this data this is a guide to the docs that I used ==> https://gallop.readme.io/docs
At the moment the documentation is down but I already used it and have a clean data set which is in the Project Data folder.

## Description of Data
The data in the file Project_Data/DataVizData.csv is the collection of all BAYC transactiosn that have involves direct sales. There are several key data points: 1)Token id of the sale 2) UNIX time stamp of the sale and 3)All involved traits for the given NFT, these values have already been 'dummied' for simplicity.

## Data Interest
I currently have an NFT valuation startup called apraizr, you can check out my work at apraizr.xyz, It is nft valuation as a service. I hope to use this data to create an analytics page for my site. I am interested in exploring trends of certain features as well as bookmarking the sales over time. I also plan to showcase celebtiy NFTs as part of the project.

## Data Points
I can use all of the features in the dataset. Its time series data so for the most part we will be looking at sales over time in some regard.

## Data Concerns
None. Except maybe the process of datacleaning on javascript. I already have a very long cleaning process with python and am not sure if I am expected to re-write this in javascript.

## Source
I would say this this primary source, it comes directly from the Ethereum blockchain.
