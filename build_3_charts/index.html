      <h2>This is a barchart of the distribution of the age of shooting victims. This tells the story of what age group is being most targeted by police. This is an
          effective chart because the reader can understand if there is a group that is being particularly targeted. And we see that mostly younger people
          end up being killed by police but also that there is a wide range.

  <div id='area_chart'>
      <h2> This is an area chart of shootings over the course of the year. This tells the story of when people are shot and killed by police officers the most.
          There is a belief that most crime/murders happens in summer and I was curious to see if the same trend would be true for killings by police. This graph
          tells the story that the same trend doesn't exist here.

  <div id='my_dataviz'>
    <h2> This is an pie chart of shootings by race. This tells the story of which races are being targeted by police. Many people already hold the belief that Black people
        are most targeted by police killings by the reality is that White people end up getting killed the most. What this graph does show is that
        Black people are being killed more than they are represented in the overall population which may be a sign they are being overly targeted.
